## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Gemini API key (provided: `AIzaSyDzTSzogzG7ntlLHBOoHISaKC12g4ljW-s`)

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

**Option 1: Automated Setup**
1. **Run the setup script**
   ```bash
   setup_and_run.bat
   ```
   This will automatically install dependencies, generate sample data, and start the application.

**Option 2: Manual Setup**
1. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\DELL\Downloads\BI PP"
   ```

2. **Install minimal dependencies (recommended to avoid conflicts)**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt
   ```

3. **Generate sample data for testing**
   ```bash
   python -c "from utils.sample_data_generator import save_sample_datasets; save_sample_datasets()"
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`
   - The Gemini API key is already configured in the application

### Troubleshooting Installation Issues

If you encounter the `onnxruntime` error:
- Use `requirements_minimal.txt` instead of `requirements.txt`
- This removes CrewAI dependencies that cause conflicts
- The application will work with Gemini AI only (still full-featured)
